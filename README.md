# Glowbom Game Builder

In development.

## NFT Games

Glowbom Game Builder lets you build an NFT quest game using Moralis SDK.

It easily connects to the ETH wallet and lets you build interactive stories and quizzes.

Each game element can be tight to a specific NFT in the wallet, and the element won't be available if a user doesn't have this NFT.

Here's [a quick demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBey-ND_D0A).

### Dependencies

Don't forget to add [**ethereum-unity-boilerplate**](https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-unity-boilerplate) to the Unity project.

## Stay tuned

The project is in active development, and we're super excited to add more gaming mechanics soon.
